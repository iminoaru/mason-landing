# Introduction

Turn your ideas into full stack applications with AI-powered code generation.

## What is ByteMason?

ByteMason is an intelligent development tool that transforms natural language descriptions into complete full stack web applications. It's designed for both beginners and experienced developers who want to:

- Build full-stack Next.js applications quickly
- Focus on business logic instead of boilerplate
- Maintain high code quality and best practices
- Automate repetitive development tasks

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Anthropic API key
- OpenAI API key


## Quick Start

```bash
# Install ByteMason
pip install bytemason

# Set up environment
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key

# Create and generate your app
berry new my-shop
cd my-shop
berry plan "Create an online shop with product catalog, 
shopping cart, and user authentication"
berry code ./spec/specification.json
```
